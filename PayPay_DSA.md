# General

    - 1st is the Hirevue Coding challenge of your choice. What I received was Add Binary number and Cash register program. Was given 120 (Max) mins to complete both the solutions.
    - 2nd was Technical interview. Beware, the Job Description and the interview is way apart, They want someone with an overall technical capability.

    - implement binary search in a sorted array.
    - Fibonacci series
    - https://github.com/ombharatiya/FAANG-Coding-Interview-Questions#faang-must-do-problems
    Q1: Return the kth largest value in an unsorted array. (Merge sort or quick sort)
    Create a module in any language that implements the LCU (least commonly used) cache data structure. With O(1) insertion, retrieval and removal.
    What's the time complexity to insert and retrieve in a hashmap? In an array? Worst case? Elaborate on the amortized time complexity for array.
    How can you guarantee consistency in the database transactions? If you have a mutex?
    What's the difference between hashmap and hashtable?
